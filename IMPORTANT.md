For my beginner self (mostly)

Problem : I run into problem making a repository in github. Specifically when I follow TOP's instructions and make an html&css file. It wont push my html/css, neither does it add it to the main repo in github (It does not "recognize", for lack of a better term, the html/css file as belonging to the repository).

Solution: Make a new folder and select it in the terminal (cmds: [1] mkdir folder_name [2] cd folder_name/ **This should open the folder**) and follow the directions that github gives (the steps are written after you click on + new repository or is just near the + new repository button at home page[I think that's what it's called]) and then open the file in vscode (if its through the terminal, just type the cmd: code .)

Additional: Do check if it works first, to avoid wasting time coding on something that can't be pushed -- try to add it in the github repo and see if there's a different message shown in the terminal.
